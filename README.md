# N-Queens-Problem

The N-Queens problem is an AI problem that is concerned with finding the number of ways that n-many queens can be placed on a chessboard so that none of the queens are attacking one another.
Implementation of solution for the N-Queens problem using hill climbing (main() function) and stochastic hill climbing (main1() function) algorithms.
Code for desigining the N-Queens problem was obtained from the Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach textbook.
